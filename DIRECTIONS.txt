Well first off, thank you for downloading my game, I hope you enjoy it.

Controls:
********************************
Ctrl = Bombs

Shift = Guns

Arrow keys = respective movement

Escape = Quit

These are the defaults, you may
define them to be different at
any time.
********************************

Object
********************************
The object is to save as many
people as possible before dying.
You must fly low enough and slow
enough for them to get on and then
fly back to base where you drop
them off.
*********************************

Things you should know
*********************************
You can bomb and shoot the people
as well as the tanks.  Once a 
person is dead you get a red
talley.  If you save him you get
a black talley.

Tanks take 12 shots (on regular
difficulty) from the gun to die.  
The bombs depends on how direct
of a hit you had.

The tanks will revive after a
while.  I'm not sure how long,
but enough to get down and save
the people.

Difficulty level makes a big
difference.  You should start out
easy.
*********************************
*********************************
This is a work in progress.  I'm
sure there are bugs and things I
can improve upon.  Please just
try to bear with me as I come out
with newr versions.  If you find
any bugs or have any suggestions,
PLEASE e-mail me at CEBjorkl@UOP.com

	ENJOY!!!
